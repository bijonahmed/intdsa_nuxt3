                                        <h2 class="mt-4">5. Payment Terms</h2>
                                        <p>DS international agency is working globally and using USDT for transaction.
                                            Payment processing 24 hours available for deposit and withdrawal minimum
                                            limit is 20USDT and for make first withdrawal need to complete first time
                                            orders.</p>

                                        <h2 class="mt-4">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                                        <p>There are many things you can't guarantee won't happen when someone uses your
                                            website, and you don't want to be sued to kingdom come if one of those
                                            things takes place. Therefore, it's a great idea to ensure that you're not,
                                            in fact, liable, far as to practically say that the company isn't liable for
                                            anything at all, ever...except in some geographic locations.</p>

                                        <h2 class="mt-4">7. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
                                        <p>Note that the company's Terms of Service doesn't detail its return policy,
                                            but it does mention such a policy. It tells customers that information on
                                            returns is located in a separate, specific agreement on that subject.
                                            Cancelling of orders and returning of orders DS will proceed and give
                                            returns to drop shippers.</p>

                                        <h2 class="mt-4">8. Jurisdiction and Conflict Resolution</h2>
                                        <p>Should conflicts arise, your customers need to know the legal process you
                                            follow to resolve them. You should also make clear under which state (or
                                            country's) laws dispute resolution will take place.</p>

                                        <h2 class="mt-4">9. Copyrights & Rights of Modifications</h2>
